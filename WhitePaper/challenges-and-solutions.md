#### Introduction
Federated authentication typically involves transfer of personal data stored in the user account at the IdP to the SP.
The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) on the SP side checks the information transmitted from the IdP regarding authorization.

Therefore, data protection regulations apply to this cross-organizational transfer of personal data.
If both the IdP and the SP reside in the same jurisdiction, then the data protection regulation of this jurisdiction apply.

If the IdP and SP are located in different jurisdictions, then a legal basis for the cross-jurisdictional transfer of personal data must be found.

Depending on the specific use case and requirements, special sub-types of identity federations may be designed,
e.g. anonymous federations (the IdP sends information to the SP that is anonymous from the point of view of the SP)
or delegated authorization where (most of the) authorization checks are delegated from the SP to the IdP.


#### The General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) defines a common data protection framework for the member states of the EU
as well as entities worldwide that provide services inside the EU that involve the processing of personal data (Article 3 GDPR, territorial scope, https://gdpr-info.eu/art-3-gdpr/).

If personal data shall be transferred outside the territorial scope of the GDPR, additional GDPR requirements must be met that are laid down in Chapter 5 of the GDPR (https://gdpr-info.eu/art-44-gdpr/).
This applies to "third countries" as well as International Organisations such as ESA and EUMETSAT ("IO", Article 4 no. 26 GDPR)
